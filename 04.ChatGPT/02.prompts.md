In the user prompt for any got based API call, I say "the output should a list of key value pairs where key is the original input and value is the <task performed by gpt> and it should be parse-able by pythons ast.literal_eval and nothing else."

ast.literal_eval() is used to parse code from strings. You can look up more information about it online.

The idea is that gpt understands what pythons literal_eval is supposed to do so I ask it to always send the outputs to me in that fashion only.
